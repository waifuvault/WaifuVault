## WaifuVault

WaifuVault is a temporary file hosting service, that allows for file uploads that are hosted for a set amount of time.

The amount of time a given file is hosted for is determined by its size. Files are hosted for a maximum of 365 days,
with the time being shortened on a cubic curve. This means for files up to about 50% of maximum file size will get
close to the maximum time. Beyond that, the time allotted drops off sharply, with the maximum size file getting 30 days
of hosting.

## Getting started

> **Important!** This requires Docker, Node >= 20 and TypeScript >= 5.5

`.env` file must be created for this application to work. Rename `.envExample` to `.env`

#### Postgres

> **Important!** If you are using postgres, read the following, these settings will be used by docker-compose to create
> the image

You mut create a file called `postgres.env` and fill in the following info

|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FILE_SIZE_UPLOAD_LIMIT_MB | Limit on size of file allowed to be uploaded                            |
| SESSION_KEY               | Replace 'YourSessionKey' with a random string to use as the session key |

> **Note Well** the file size sets the time to live for a file, so files close to the upload limit will only be hosted
> for 30 days. It is a cubic curve so files up to 50% of the size will get close to a year of hosting time.

> **SALT ISSUES - IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ** <br>
> If you change the salt setting after password protected files have been added, you will no longer be able to access
> the files encrypted with the older salt.

## Buckets Admin Feature

Buckets are virtual collections of files that can be accessed with a token. When a bucket is created, the token is
provided.

> **Note Well** The bucket key provides full access to the files, including the ability to delete them, do not share the
> bucket key.
> It is intended to provide users the ability to manage their own files.

### Usage

To login to the bucket admin page, use the following URL, relative to the base URL:

```
/admin/bucket
```

Once the key is provided, the user will be taken to the file management page. This is very similar to the main file
management page of the admin feature, but restricted to the files contained in the bucket.

Buckets can be created from the login page by using the `Create Bucket` button. This will create and populate a bucket
token.

## Albums Admin Feature

Albums are sub-collections of files within a bucket. Albums can be publicly shared, to provide simple access to
a collection of files.

> **Note Well** One time download files cannot be included in albums.

### Creating Albums

To create an album, click on the `Create album` button in the main upper table.
Fill in the name you would like for the album and then click `Create Album` in the dialog.

A new tab for the album will then appear in the bottom Albums table.

![CreateAlbum](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737302267058/CreateAlbum.png)

### Deleting Albums

To delete an album, in the bottom albums table, select the tab for the album you wish to delete. Then
in the bottom right, click on the `Delete Album` button.

A dialog will then come up asking you if you want to also delete the files in the album. If you choose
`Yes` then the files will be deleted from both the album and the bucket. If you choose `No` then the
files will be removed from the album, but not deleted from the bucket.

![DeleteAlbum](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737302605135/DeleteAlbum.png)

### Sharing Albums

Albums can be publicly shared. This will provide you with a URL that can be used to view and download the
files within the album.

> **Note Well** One time download files cannot be included in albums, and files which are protected will
> still need the password to download.

To share an album, select the tab for the album in the bottom albums section, and then click on the `Share Album`
button in the bottom left.

This will add a new button with the public URL in the middle of the bottom bar. Clicking on this button
will copy the URL to the clipboard for you.

![ShareAlbum](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737303000335/ShareAlbum.png)

To revoke sharing an album, select the tab for the album in the bottom albums section, and then click on
the `Unshare Album` button in the bottom left.

The green URL button will now disappear and the album will be private only again.

> **Note Well** If you unshare an album, the original album share URL is destroyed. If you share it again afterwards
> the URL will be different.

![UnshareAlbum](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737303226165/UnshareAlbum.png)

### Public Album Interface

The public album access interface is available using the URL provided by sharing an album.

This provides the ability to view and download files within an album from a public URL. It also provides the
ability to download the files within an album as a zip file.

> **Note Well** The password will still be required for individual protected files within an album and
> they will not be included in the zip file download.

Two views are provided. The default view is the card view, which provides a thumbnail for those file
types that support it. Type icons will be shown for those that do not.

The card view can also be selected by clicking on the grid icon at the top right of the page.

Selecting individual files by using the checkboxes in the bottom left of the file card allows you to
select the files you want to download in the zip file.

If no files are selected then all files will be downloaded in the zip file.

![PublicCCards](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737303700564/PublicCardsAlbum.png)

A table view of the files within the album is also available by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top
left of the page.

Selecting individual files by using the checkboxes next to the filename allows you to
select the files you want to download in the zip file.

If no files are selected then all files will be downloaded in the zip file.

![PublicTable](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737304001712/PublicTableAlbum.png)

### Album File Management

To add files from the main bucket table to an album, select the files you want to add from the upper bucket table
and then click on `Add to Album`, and select the name of the album you wish to add the files to.

> **Note Well** Files can only be assigned to one album at a time. If you choose a file which is already assigned
> to another album, it will be moved to the chosen album.

![AddFilesToAlbum](https://waifuvault.moe/f/1737304346693/AddFilesAlbum.png)

## Admin Feature

This application comes with a useful admin site that will allow you to control the files that are uploaded, and to
provide security control with the ability to ban abusive IPs.

The site also features statistics to allow you to at-a-glance see information on the files that have been uploaded.

### Setup

On first startup you need to pay attention to the logs printed to screen - it will provide you with a username and
password that can be used to log in to the admin. This is random and only provided once. The line looks like this:

```batch
New user created: email: "foo@example.com" password: "password" Please change this upon logging in!
```

> **Tip** For first startup run manually, so you can easily find the log file on screen

To get to the admin interface, go to **/login**, where you will provide the
email and password from above.

Once you are logged in, you can click on the **Change Details** button, where you can change the email address
and password.

> **Note Well** It is recommended you change the default username and password at first startup. The system will not
> provide the default password again.

### Usage

Once in the admin, you can see what files have been uploaded and sort them by any of the available columns.
You can also ban and unban IP addresses from here, and download any files that have been uploaded. You can change your
username and password, and can view overall stats on the files that have been uploaded.
